Today is a good day. 

I'm making scrambled eggs and oatmeal for breakfast while listening to Bossa Nova. Silas seems to like this music; he dances to it anytime it plays. He’s 9 and a half months old.

Raspberries are in season. The garden is flourishing with squash and cherry tomatoes. The garlic will be ready to harvest soon.

It's the perfect temperature to go for a walk.

The boat is in the water. Lukas fixed it yesterday and sailed it to the marina with Ian.

The fridge is full of good food.

We’re all healthy.

There is a lot of love to go around.
