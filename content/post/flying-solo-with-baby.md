At 4 months I took my first flight with my baby boy. Alone! And I'm happy to report that flying with a baby isn't as bad as you might fear. Here's my story along with tips and insights to hopefully help you have a smooth trip of your own.

Before having a kid, I was a frequent flyer and I admit to getting nervous as the mother and infant combo slowly made their way down the aisle towards the empty seat next to me, and then quietly thanking greater powers when they passed my row.

But now I have a baby. I also have *much* more sympathy for all you mothers out there.

Just a few weeks after he was born, while making plans to visit his grandparents, I realized that every flight (for the next while) I'll be sitting next to a baby no matter what.

How can I make flight as pain-free and quiet as possible? What baby gizmos might come in handy? How will diaper changes work?

Must haves in the carry-on:
---------------------------

-   Extra set of clothes for both you and baby
-   Baby carrier. I recommend a [Moby wrap](https://amzn.to/3KMMr3P) or something [similar](https://amzn.to/4etPXh2).  
-   A few toys. Don't go overboard; a small crinkle book, a teether, and a terry cloth was all I packed. Here's a great all-in-one with a pleasant, gentle [rattle](https://amzn.to/3RunJZP).
-   2 [pacifiers](https://amzn.to/3RunJZP). Keep both of them in an ready to access pocket on your person. One will end up on the floor and you'll need a clean replacement ASAP
-   [Hand sanitizer](https://amzn.to/3VvxRm6) 
-   [Bubbles](https://amzn.to/3RAuSYv) This one comes in a 32 pack. Having several spares lets you keep emergency bubbles in every bag! 
-   Travel [changing pad](https://amzn.to/3Vr8P7U)
-   [Blanket scarf  ](https://amzn.to/4cm3zsW)Used as a nursing cover, play mat, blanket, and fashion statement! A patterned scarf is better for hiding inevitable stains.

I did perfectly fine without a stroller and opted instead to counter the front carrier weight with a carry on [backpack](https://amzn.to/4cm3zsW). In fact, I never bought a diaper bag. I just use a backpack I already had.
