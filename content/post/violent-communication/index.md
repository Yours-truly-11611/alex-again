### ~~Non~~\-Violent Communication

{{< figure src="/crash.jpg" title="A plane I encountered in the back country." >}}


Someone was writing about nonviolent communication in the group I journal with, which got me thinking about the exact opposite- ultimate violence communication.

What is violence but a language, a means with which we communicate with others, an exertion of power to shape the world in our favor? Should I not be fluent in this universal language? Now, this doesnâ€™t mean that I want to exercise violence; I just want to understand it, which involves understanding when violence is appropriate and even necessary as a form of communication.

Perhaps in understanding physical violence, I can better understand what hidden violence can be found within myself and others.
